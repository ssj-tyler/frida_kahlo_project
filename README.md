# frida_kahlo_project
My first off-platform Codecademy portfolio project, completed July 2022.

This was a Codecademy project that tested your knowledge on lists, tuples, the .zip function, the range function and how to think about zero indexing, and in a broader sense how to use Jupyter Notebook and Git since this project couldn't be completed off-platform without that. I didn't know how to use GitHub at the time so I am uploading this now for my portfolio.

At the time I didn't know that with Notebooks the print() function is essentially redundant, so it's funny to look back and see that now. :)
